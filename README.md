WeatherApp
Overview:
WeatherApp is an Android application designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on their current location or a location of their choice. Developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Retrofit, the app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for a structured and maintainable codebase. It features a dynamic search functionality that suggests locations as you type.

Features:

1)Current Weather Information: Displays real-time weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and weather description.

2)Location-Based Updates: Retrieves weather updates based on the user’s current location using the device’s GPS.

3)Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather information in different locations with suggestions provided as they type.

4)Modern UI: Utilizes Jetpack Compose to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.

5)MVVM Architecture: Implements MVVM for a clean separation of UI, business logic, and data layers.

6)Network Operations: Uses Retrofit for efficient and type-safe network operations.


Technologies Used:


Kotlin: The primary programming language for Android development.

Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native UI in Android.

Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java for network operations.

MVVM Architecture: Provides a structured approach to app development by separating concerns.

Weather API: Provides weather data used by the app.

Location Services: Retrieves the user’s current location for weather updates.

Autocomplete API: Provides location suggestions as users type in the search box.

Usage:

Launch the App: Open the app on your device or emulator.

Fetch Weather Based on Location: The app automatically retrieves and displays weather information based on your current location using GPS. Make sure location services are enabled on your device.

Search for Specific Locations: Use the search bar to type in a location. As you type, suggestions for locations will appear based on the autocomplete functionality. Select a suggested location to view its weather information.

Dependencies:
Jetpack Compose UI

Retrofit for network operations

Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming
